## Description

myGym is an iOS application developed in Swift that aims to simplify and optimize the gym workout experience for users. Often, gym-goers find themselves lost, not knowing which exercises to do or how to best organize their workout. With myGym, we have created a comprehensive tool to allow users to create, organize, and track their workout programs effectively and intuitively.
